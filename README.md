##JDK
</br>
The **Java Development Kit (JDK)** is a distribution of Java Technology by Oracle Corporation. It implements the **Java Language Specification (JLS)** and the **Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS)** and provides the Standard Edition (SE) of the Java Application Programming Interface (API). It is derivative of the community driven OpenJDK which Oracle stewards.
</br>
##JRE
</br>
The **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** released by Oracle is a freely available software distribution containing a stand-alone JVM (HotSpot), the Java standard library (Java Class Library), a configuration tool, and—until its discontinuation in JDK 9—a browser plug-in. It is the most common Java environment installed on personal computers in the laptop and desktop form factor. Mobile phones including feature phones and early smartphones that ship with a JVM are most likely to include a JVM meant to run applications targeting Micro Edition of the Java platform.
